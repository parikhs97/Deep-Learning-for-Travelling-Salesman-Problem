Deep Learning for Travelling Salesman Problem

The objective of the project is to solve classic combinatorial optimization problem - Travelling Salesman Problem - using
deep learning algorithm. Problem Statement of the Travelling Salesman Problem is ”Given a list of cities and distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the returns to the origin city?”.
